# mpx-assembly

Monkeypox assembly workflow from Twist enrichment

Notes:

* Note: `Snipit` variant locations are 0-based, `iVar` variant locations 1-based
* Investigate: apparent discrepency between `Snipit` variants from MAFFT multiple sequence alignment and `iVar` variants (e.g. in MPX_D_5 - 4 SNPs vs 3 SNPs)
