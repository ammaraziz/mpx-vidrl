# Template for patient data used in reports

Meta data is used to provide details for the report (within and between patient diversity, variant plots, annotations) and **to annotate consensus sequence headers for upload and publication**. De-identified and anonymous patient data should be used in line with governance and ethics, unless reports or sequences are shared internally and in compliance with local regulations.
